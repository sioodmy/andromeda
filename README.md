# Andromeda [WIP]

My desktop setup without home manager (because why not). It mainly uses wrapper-manager for everything and aims to be easily customizable with base16 color schemes.

Note that for now it's only my personal configuration, it can be used by other people that want to try my setup without conflicting with their existing configuration. However I do not plan to turn it into any kind of community framework like home-manager.
